Do you create or curate YouTube videos? Now turn your website with YouTube links into an engagement platform. TLDR: Youtube channel on your site.
 

== Description ==
You don't need more storage or bandwidth, and your visitors hate leaving the webpage they've already loaded, so why don't you show your videos and playlists in your own website.
	
Tell this plugin your YouTube username and it'll setup your channel in your own property.

**What it'll display :**

* Banner image.
* Profile picture and username.
* Total videos and views.
* Uploads (sorted by views.)
* Playlists (lists videos on that playlist on click).
* Banner image in footer.

You can put YourChannel shortcode in posts or any custome fields.
Shortcode looks like `[yourchannel user="you"]`.

YourChannel is completely responsive (shouldn't have mentioned, IT'S 2015).

**[Demo](http://plugin.builders/yourchannel/?demo=free)**

== Installation ==
Upload YourChannel folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
Go to Settings > YourChannel.
Fill in the inputs with your API key, (we've left our API key for you to get started, but you should get your own) YouTube username and some other preferences.

Put the shortcode generated anywhere in your posts. (Also supports custom fields.)
