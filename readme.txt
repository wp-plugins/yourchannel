Do you create or curate YouTube videos? Now turn your website with YouTube links into an engagement platform.
 

== Description ==
You don't need more storage or bandwidth, and your visitors hate leaving the webpage they've already loaded, so why don't you show your videos and playlists in your own website.
	
Tell this plugin your YouTube username or channel ID and it'll setup your channel in your own property.

**What it displays :**

* Banner image, profile picture and username.
* Total videos and views.
* Uploads (sorted by views.)
* Playlists (lists videos on that playlist on click). (Optional)
* Banner image in footer.
* Default color accent is Black & White.
* Smooooth animations.


You can put YourChannel shortcode in posts or any custome fields.
Shortcode looks like `[yourchannel user="you"]`.

YourChannel is completely responsive (shouldn't have mentioned, IT'S 2015).

Don't let visitors leave your site for YouTube.
